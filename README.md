# Coding For Humanities 
 
 
Most of my early learning-to-code type repos were private and a little chaotic.
This is an attempt to be a little more systematic with the learning process.

This repo is named Coding For Humanities for a reason: all the work done here -
whether in the form of learning or projects - will focus on an aspect of
humanities - specifically text analysis. 

My initial applications will be with my own fictional writing, but will then
extend to more generalistic applications around the research work I have to
carry out when working on fictional works. Some projects in the pipeline
include: 

TODO:

- [] Character Name Generator

- [] Character Arc Plotter
