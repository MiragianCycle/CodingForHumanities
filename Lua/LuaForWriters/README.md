# Day 1 Syllabus:

## Hour 1: Getting Started with Lua
- **15 minutes**: Introduction to Lua programming language.
  - Lua is a lightweight, high-level scripting language designed for embedded systems and extensibility.
  - It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with other languages.
- **15 minutes**: Install Lua interpreter/compiler.
  - Lua can be easily installed on various platforms using package managers like LuaRocks or by downloading the binaries from the official website.
- **30 minutes**: Basics of Lua syntax:
  - Variables and data types (strings, numbers, booleans).
    - Variables are declared using the `local` keyword and can store different types of data.
    - Lua has dynamic typing, meaning variables can hold values of any type.
  - Basic operations (arithmetic, comparison, logical).
    - Lua supports common arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - Comparison operators include equal to `==`, not equal to `~=`, greater than `>`, less than `<`, etc.
    - Logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` are used for logical operations.

## Hour 2: Control Structures
- **20 minutes**: Introduction to control structures:
  - If statements (if, elseif, else).
    - If statements allow conditional execution of code blocks based on the evaluation of boolean expressions.
    - Syntax: `if condition then ... elseif condition then ... else ... end`
  - Logical operators (and, or, not).
    - Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in if statements.
    - `and` returns true if both conditions are true, `or` returns true if at least one condition is true, and `not` negates a condition.
- **20 minutes**: Loops:
  - while loop.
    - Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
    - Syntax: `while condition do ... end`
  - for loop (numeric and generic forms).
    - Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
    - Syntax: `for variable = startValue, endValue, stepValue do ... end`
- **20 minutes**: Hands-on practice:
  - Writing simple Lua scripts to understand control structures.
  - Exercises to reinforce understanding of loops and conditional statements.

## Hour 3: Functions and Basic Scripting
- **30 minutes**: Introduction to functions:
  - Syntax for defining and calling functions.
  - Parameters and return values.
    - Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
    - Syntax: `function functionName(param1, param2, ...) ... end`
- **20 minutes**: Writing modular Lua code:
  - Organizing code into reusable functions.
  - Creating and calling custom functions.
- **10 minutes**: Q&A and troubleshooting:
  - Address any questions or issues encountered during exercises.
- **20 minutes**: Hands-on scripting exercise:
  - Develop a simple Lua script to solve a basic problem (e.g., calculate the area of a rectangle, convert temperature units).
