# Lisp Programming for Novelists: A Creative Approach

## 1. Introduction to Lisp Syntax

;; This is a comment in Lisp

;; Expressions are enclosed in parentheses
(+ 2 3)  ; This adds 2 and 3

;; Functions are called by putting them at the start of a list
(print "Hello, World!")

;; Variables can be bound using the `setq` function

;; This is a list of numbers
(1 2 3 4 5)

;; This is a list of symbols
(apple banana cherry)

;; Define a variable
(defvar *my-name* "Alice")

;; Define a simple function
(defun greet (name)
  (format t "Hello, ~a!" name))

;; Use the function
(greet *my-name*)

;; If statement (like a fork in a story)
(if (> word-count 50000)
    (print "You've written a novel!")
    (print "Keep writing!"))

;; Loop (like repeating a scene in a story)
(loop for chapter from 1 to 10
      do (format t "Writing chapter ~d~%" chapter))

;; Create a list of characters
(defvar *characters* '(protagonist sidekick villain))

;; Add a character to the list
(push 'mentor *characters*)

;; Remove a character from the list
(setq *characters* (remove 'villain *characters*))

;; Process each character (like developing each in your story)
(mapcar #'(lambda (character) 
            (format t "Developing ~a's backstory~%" character))
        *characters*)


Learn the basics of Lisp's unique syntax:

- **Lists**: Ordered collections of elements.
- **Symbols**: Names used to represent variables, functions, and other entities.
- **Parentheses**: Used to group expressions.
- **Quotes**: Used to quote expressions, preventing evaluation.

## 2. Lists and Symbols: The Building Blocks

Understand the fundamental structures in Lisp:

- **Lists**: Ordered collections of elements.
- **Symbols**: Names used to represent variables, functions, and other entities.
