# Common Lisp for Humanities and Social Sciences

Welcome to the Common Lisp notebook tailored for humanities and social sciences! This resource aims to introduce the expressive power of Common Lisp to non-programmers in academic domains seeking deeper insights through coding.

## What is Common Lisp?

Common Lisp is a robust and expressive programming language known for its versatility and power. It enables users to explore functional programming paradigms, making it a compelling choice for scholars interested in delving into programming without sacrificing depth.

## Why Common Lisp for Humanities and Social Sciences?

- **Functional Programming:** Learn about functional programming concepts for text analysis and data manipulation.
- **Expressive Capabilities:** Leverage the language's expressive nature for complex data operations or textual analysis.
- **Historical Significance:** Explore a language with a rich history and influence in the computing world.

## Getting Started

To begin your exploration of Common Lisp:

- **Install a Common Lisp Compiler:** Choose from implementations like SBCL or CLISP. [SBCL Installation Guide](http://www.sbcl.org/getting.html)
- **Open the Notebook:** Launch your Common Lisp environment and open the provided notebook to start coding.
